        <h1>D3 Visualization</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The following bubble chart presents project management information 
            for the 15 executive departments of the United States administration,
            between the period of 2006 to 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each bubble in the chart represents a department, labeled by its official 
            abbreviation. Departments are positioned according to their Average Cost Variance 
            percentage (x-axis), and their Average Schedule Variance percentage (y-axis), 
            for all the projects they started within the above mentioned period. 
            According to their positioning each department falls in one of four distinct categories: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In Time - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                    schedule and within their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Late - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                    schedule but within their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Late - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                    schedule and excede their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Time - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                    schedule but excede their initial budget.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The area of each bubble is proportioned to the total number of projects carried out
            by that department. The larger the bubble is the more projects this department had initiated between 2006-2012.
            The color of each bubble, ranging from light purple to a darker shade,
            represents the average project cost in millions for each department. The darker a bubble is 
            the higher their average project cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legend, on the side of the chart, contains a list of all the departments in the visualisation.
            On the left of the department's name there is a small circle colored as the corresponding bubble 
            in the chart. On the right side of the department's name there is the number of initiated
            projects, on top of a blue bar that visualises this number. The departments in the legend
            appear in ascending order according the their total number of projects.
        </p>
        <h2>Interactivity</h2>
        <p>
            Hovering with the mouse over a bubble in the chart, will cause the bubble to grow in size and to turn opaque. 
            A tooltip box will appear to the right side of the bubble, containing the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>The complete official name of the department</li>
                <li>The total number of projects it initiated between 2006-2012</li>
                <li>
                    A color scale, with an animated index, which indicates
                    the average project cost of that particular department in million dollars, and
                    how that relates to the lowest and highest average project cost among all 
                    other departments.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hovering over the items in the legend, makes them to highlight, while the corresponding
            bubble in the chart grows in size and turns opaque.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            This visualisation is intended for the United States administration, and aims to help them
            identify the executive departments that on average excede their initial schedule and budget
            when carrying out a project. Based on the results of the current analysis and visualisation,
            emerges the need for a more focused analysis that will investigate the reasons behind the 
            innefieciency of particular departments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information on the average project cost and number of projects per departent, that are also presented
            in the visualisation, are useful in order to help the administration decide in which of the innefficient 
            departments the problem is more urgent. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            For example, the Department of Defense, is positioned close to the 
            Department of Education, in the "Late &amp; Out of Budget" quarter of the graph, however the issue is
            significantly more serious in the Department of Defense, since on average each project costs 20.26
            million dollars, with a total number of 66 projects, whereas in the Department of Education the average 
            project cost is only 1.63 millions, with a total number of 26 projects. Arguably, it is more urgent 
            to tackle the innefieciency in the Department of Defense because it introduces higher absolute costs.
