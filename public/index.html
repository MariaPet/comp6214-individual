                        <p> The following bubble chart was created with the use of the d3.js Javascript library and
                            presents project management information for the 15 executive departments of 
                            the United States administration, between the period of 2006 to 2012.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each bubble in the chart represents a department, labeled by its official 
                            abbreviation. Departments are positioned according to their Average Schedule Variance 
                            percentage (x-axis), and their Average Cost Variance percentage (y-axis), 
                            for all the projects they started within the above mentioned period. 
                            According to their positioning each department falls in one of four distinct categories: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In Time - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                                    schedule and within their initial budget.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Late - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                                    schedule but within their initial budget.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Late - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                                    schedule and excede their initial budget.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In Time - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                                    schedule but excede their initial budget.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The area of each bubble is proportioned to the total number of projects carried out
                            by that department. The larger the bubble is the more projects this department had initiated between 2006-2012.
                            The radius of each bubble is calculated with this formula 
                            <span style="font-family: monospace">`Math.sqrt(d["Projects Number"]/Math.PI) * 5;`</span> 
                            (it is multiplied by 5, to collectively increase the bubble size for each department)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The color of each bubble, ranging from light purple to a darker shade,
                            represents the average project cost in millions for each department. The darker a bubble is 
                            the higher their average project cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legend, on the side of the chart, contains a list of all the departments in the visualisation.
                            On the left of the department's name there is a small circle colored as the corresponding bubble 
                            in the chart. On the right side of the department's name there is the number of initiated
                            projects, on top of a blue bar that visualises this number. The departments in the legend
                            appear in ascending order according the their total number of projects.

                            Hovering with the mouse over a bubble in the chart, will cause the bubble to grow in size and to turn opaque. 
                            A tooltip box will appear to the right side of the bubble, containing the following information:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The complete official name of the department</li>
                                <li>The total number of projects it initiated between 2006-2012</li>
                                <li>
                                    A color scale, with an animated index, which indicates
                                    the average project cost of that particular department in million dollars, and
                                    how that relates to the lowest and highest average project cost among all 
                                    other departments.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This tooltip box contains information related to a department that are not very clear on
                            the chart, such as the full department name and the actual amounts of projects and average
                            project cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hovering over the items in the legend, makes them to highlight, while the corresponding
                            bubble in the chart grows in size and turns opaque. The category label of the chart quarter in which 
                            the bubble is positioned, turns bold and its font-size grows, in order to highlight
                            the category in which the department falls in. This interaction aims to allow users easily
                            identify a particular department they are interested in on the chart, just by looking at the legend. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the top right corner of the legend there is the option to sort
                            the departments in ascending order based on the average project cost, by
                            clicking on it. Sorting the items in the legend is a convenient way to manage the data by exception.
                            For example, it's easier to identify where are positioned in the chart the departments with the highest 
                            average project cost.

                            This visualisation is intended for the United States administration, and aims to help them
                            identify the executive departments that on average excede their initial schedule and budget
                            when carrying out a project. The decision to render the data in a bubble chart was taken
                            beacuse it is a clear way to display the distribution of the different departments, in the four 
                            possible categories that are defined by the x and y axis. A bubble chart is also a convenient way
                            to include extra information by differenciating the size and the colour of each bubble.

                            Based on the results of the current analysis and visualisation,
                            emerges the need for a more focused analysis that will investigate the reasons behind the 
                            inefficiency of particular departments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Information on the average project cost and number of projects per department, that are also presented
                            in the visualisation, are useful in order to help the administration decide in which of the inefficient 
                            departments the problem is more urgent. 
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            For example, the Department of Defense, is positioned close to the 
                            Department of Education, in the "Late &amp; Out of Budget" quarter of the graph, however the issue is
                            significantly more serious in the Department of Defense, since on average each project costs 20.26
                            million dollars, with a total number of 66 projects, whereas in the Department of Education the average 
                            project cost is only 1.63 millions, with a total number of 26 projects. Arguably, it is more urgent 
                            to tackle the inefficiency in the Department of Defense because it introduces higher absolute costs.
