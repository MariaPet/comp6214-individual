        <h2>Visualisation Description</h2>
        <p> The following bubble chart presents project management information 
            for the 15 executive departments of the United States administration,
            between the period of 2006 to 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each bubble in the chart represents a department, labeled by its official 
            abbreviation. Bubbles are positioned according to their Average Cost Variance 
            percentage (x-axis), and their Average Schedule Variance percentage (y-axis), 
            for all the projects they started within the above mentioned period. 
            According to their positioning each department falls in one of four distinct categories: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In Time - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                    schedule and within their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Late - In Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                    schedule but within their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Late - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects behind
                    schedule and excede their initial budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Time - Out of Budget: Departments that on average complete projects ahead of
                    schedule but excede their initial budget.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The area of each bubble is proportioned to the total number of projects carried out
            by that department, the larger the bubble is the more projects this department had initiated between 2006-2012.
            The color of each bubble, ranging from light purple to a darker shade,
            represents the average project cost in millions for each department, the darker a bubble is 
            the higher their average project cost.
        </p>
        <h2>Interactivity</h2>
        <p>
            Hovering over a bubble in the chart a tooltip box will appear to the right side of the bubble,
            containing the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>The complete official name of the department</li>
                <li>The total number of projects it initiated between 2006-2012</li>
                <li>A color scale, with an animated index</li>
            </ul>
