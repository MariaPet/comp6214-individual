For the first part of this coursework, Open Refine was used for 
the cleaning of the dataset. During the cleaning the following 
5 types of erros were identified and fixed:

1) Multiple representations of the same data

In the "Agency Name" column there were multiple representations for
a single agency. For example sometimes the same agency was mentioned by
its full name and in other cases just by its abbreviation. 

To fix this inconsistency I applied the text facet on the "Agency Name"
and the "Agency Code" column. Then I tried to cluster together the 
agency names to identify potential multiple representations. Some of the 
multiple reprseantations could not be spotted by the clustering tool, so I filtered
by "Agency Code" as well and manually changed the remaining different name
instancies of a single agency to its full name.

2) Duplicate lines

The following pairs of records were duplicates: 2300-2301, 
499-500, 1004-1005 and 1743-1744. 

To locate the issue with duplicate records I applied text facets
on the "Unique Investment Identifier", the "Project ID", and the 
"Agency Project ID" columns, and I sorted the values by count. By investigating the 
values that had a count more than one I was able to identify potential 
duplicates and flag them. I compared the flagged records and deleted 
the duplicates.

3) Mixed use of numeric scales

I discovered that in the "Lifecycle Cost" column, that contains values 
in millions of dollars, some of the values were expressed as decimal numbers
while some others as text with the the indication of " ($m)" next to the actual 
numeric value.

To fix this error I editted the cells of the column by applying two transformations.
At first, I searched by a custom text facet with the regex \(\$m\) for the number of results
that matched it, to make sure it was equal to the non numeric values of the column. 
Then removed the extra " ($m)" by running the following command replace(value, " ($m)", "").
Finally I transformed all the values of the column to numeric values.

4) Inconsistent formats of dates

At the "Completion Date (B1)" column it was easy to spot that the value of
the first record was in a different date format than the rest.

To identify all occurencies of date formats such as the one in the first record
I applied a custom text facet to that column, using a regular expression like this
isNotNull(value.match(/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/)). Then, I manually changed all the matching 
records to the desired data format. To make sure that all the values in this column conformed
with the selected format, I applied the custom text facet isNotNull(value.match(/\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}/))
to check the number of matched records returned.

5) Redundant records with summations

There were 26 lines with redundant data containing summations of some columns. After
identifying these records with the use of text facets, I removed them from the dataset.
