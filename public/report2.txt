The visualisation code is contained in the "public" folder of the submission.
To host a copy of it, the contents of the "public" folder (index.html, js folder, css folder)
must be copied in a directory accessible through the web, such as the public_html
directory of the ECS web space. 


An overview of the audience and use case of the visualisation can be
found at the "Audience" panel in http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mp2n17

A description of the interactivity of the visualisation can be found 
at the "Interactivity" panel in http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mp2n17

The manipulation and aggregation of the data was conducted in a PostgreSQL
database. Bellow is the query that I ran to create a view with the data that
were used in the visualisation:

create view aggregated_data as
select "Agency Name",
avg("Schedule Variance (%)") as "Avg. Scedule Variance(%)",
avg("Cost Variance (%)") as "Avg. Cost Variance(%)",
count(*) as "Projects Number",
avg("Lifecycle Cost") as "Avg. Lifecycle Cost ($ M)",
avg("Projected/Actual Cost ($ M)") as "Avg. Project Cost ($ M)"
from analysis_data
where "Start Date" >= '2006-01-01' and "Projected/Actual Project Completion Date (B2)" < '2013-01-01'
group by "Agency Name" ;
 

The aggregated data were manually enriched by deriving the official acronym
of the U.S departments from the document that can be found at
https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB216/app1.pdf . These acronyms
are used as labels for the circles in the bubble chart instead of the full
department names, to improve readability.
